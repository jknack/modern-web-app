# A Modern Web Application Architecture

## Introduction
MWA it's an effort for making Java Web Applications less verbose and more fun.

### What is MWA?
* A set of (best) practices for building Java Web Applications using Maven 3, Servlet 3.0 and Spring 3.1+.
* It applies sensible defaults to Spring 3.1+ MVC applications.
* You don't have to learn anything specific about MWA.
* It reduces startup and configuration time of new applications.
* Organize your project and code by promoting the use of Modules.
* Finally, MWA it's an effort for making Java Web Applications less verbose and more fun.

### What is NOT MWA?
* It's NOT a framework.
* If you know Maven and Spring, you're ready to go.

## Fundamentals
### No web.xml
MWA promote the use of Servlet 3.0 for Java Web Applications (you'll need a Servlet 3.0 container: like Tomcat 7.x).

### No XML for dependency injection
MWA promote the use Java Annotation over XML, for Spring bean definitions and dependency injection. You wont find XML for configuring Spring in MWA.

### One and only one Spring Application Context
In order to simpplify the startup and configuration time, MWA creates a single/unique Spring Application Context (a.k.a as Root Context).  
The same is true for the Spring Dispatcher Servlet, there is only **one** and it's binded to the **root context**.

### JSR-330 for DI
MWA promote the use of the JSR-330 API for doing DI, but you can use the custom Spring annotations if you want to.

### Logging system
MWA use slf4j with logback as native implementation.

### Application properties, application's mode and the Environment API
MWA use a single source of properties: **application.properties**.

The application's mode controls how some application components should behave at runtime. MWA, reconize one mode as special: "dev".

Finally, all the application properties are accessible through the use of the [Environment API](http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/env/Environment.html).

### Modules
A module is a collection of reusable code and configuration for new and existing applications.

#### Characteristics
* Must to be marked with @Configuration Spring Annotation.
* Must be registered.
* The module's namespace or package is added as a source of bean definitions. What does it means? The module's package is scanned for discovering beans.
